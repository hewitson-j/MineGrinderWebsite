                <p class="paragraphs">Mine Grinder is a thriller that hooks you and take you on a trip with a group of college kids out for one last scare hurrah. Horror fans will love this daunting deadly misadventure into a forbidden mining town’s secret. It is inspired and a reverent nod to the 80’s horror movie genre and it will unnerve you to no end if you open it up. Lives converge in the underground mine known as Abismo de la Plata, Silver Abyss as it was called. Surrounded by darkness, they only have themselves to rely on as a murderer tries to snuff out their lives, one by one. They are taken on a wild ride riddled with their insecurities and inner demons, exploited by the cold hands of a machine that is as maniacal as any killer or villain in any story that came before, and a campfire legend uses them as its muse. It is a story of pain and graphic death that spirals into the weaved web of a historically insane genius from the mine’s past. What secrets does the darkness of Abismo de la Plata hold and can they find their way out before they become buried in the legend of the Silver Abyss?</p> <!-- Mine Grinder is a bloody 80’s style horror story. It starts in 2006 and is about a group of kids that decide during a Boy Scout trip after a scary ghost story around the campfire to go on a trip every year with the intent of scaring the shit out of each other. As the kids got older, the group got bigger, and the trips came scarier. The 2016’s trip was found on the dark web and the destination is to an abandoned mine in the ghost town of Abismo de Plata in the middle of nowhere, NV. Once the group gets to the town an old miner, the last resident of Abismo de Plata, tells the damn kids to “Go away and don’t come back.” The group does not listen. They head into the mine and shortly after they enter and some shenanigans, the entrance collapses. As the group tries to escape their awful and horrifying predicament, with the help of a walkie talkie and the old miner many unexplainable things start to happen. The group finds that they are being stalked by Grinder, a very malfunctioning piece of mining equipment. Bloody and grotesque murders follow as they traverse the mine… few make it out alive. -->
